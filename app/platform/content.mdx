# Policy Platform 

No one can take an informed position on everything at once. Here are some of my core priorities. These result from years of research and advocacy by groups like <Link href="https://www.portlandforward.org" target="_blank">Portland Forward</Link>, <Link href="https://www.pboregon.org" target="_blank">Participatory Budgeting Oregon</Link>, and others. These changes will help Portland achieve its place among the world's happiest, healthiest, and safest cities most efficiently. These priorities are born from my three central convictions:

1. People deserve to be part of shaping their communities. More direct community participation is better than less. Policies that embody this priority are "**Community first**" policies.
2. Learning is an essential part of design. More learning is better than less. Policies that embody this priority are "**Data-driven**" policies.
3. The long term is at least as important as the short term. Trading short-term for long-term outcomes doesn't make sense. Policies that embody this priority are "**Smart with money**" policies.

## Community First

From now on, twelve city councilors will share authority over Portland's government. 635,000 people live here. That's one city councilor for every 52,000 people. How will they know what Portlanders need and want? Elections happen every two years. That's very limited feedback in a world where the pace of change accelerates daily. This accelerating change makes it less possible for a few elected officials to respond effectively to situations that change faster than they can write new legislation. Here are three ways I'll ensure that Portlanders get a real say in shaping the city where they live.

      1. Community Budgets

    <div className="rounded-none collapse-content bg-primary text-primary-content peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white"> 
      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">Did you know that <Link href="https://www.pboregon.org/" target="_blank">Portland is the only major West-coast city without any form of participatory budgeting</Link>? This process gives residents a direct say in how to spend a portion of the city's budget. Community budgets will empower neighborhoods to identify and fund local projects that matter most to them, be it parks, road improvements, or community centers. This bottom-up approach not only increases civic engagement but also ensures that we use our resources in ways that directly benefit and reflect the needs of our communities. In the long term, we've seen that these programs also increase voter turnout, result in more confident voting, increase understanding in how government works, and generally help people take a more active role in their communities outside of the budget committee and election season.</p>

      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">Our diverse neighborhoods are one of the things that make Portland unique. <Link href="https://www.portland.gov/civic/myneighborhood" target="_blank">Neighborhood associations can be a vital part of that</Link>. At their best, they act as a bridge between the city council and the community, providing a platform to gather local voices and address local issues. My goal is to strengthen the associations through better support and resources, ensuring they have the tools to represent their communities effectively. We can help neighbors come together and engage in their communities more deeply by modernizing and reimagining the role of neighborhood associations to serve them better.</p>

With a focus on public welfare rather than profit, a public bank can offer lower interest rates and direct financial benefits back into our community, fostering local growth and sustainability.</p>

## Data-driven Government

Policy platforms only make sense when we know how to say that they're working. How do we _know_ that some new policy makes the city safer, happier, more comfortable, or more just? When can we tell? The new city council is an opportunity to set a high standard for how Portland makes legislation. Here are three ways I'll ensure that any new policies are working for us.

      1. **Policy Pre-registration** 
    </div>
    <div className="rounded-none collapse-content bg-primary text-primary-content peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white"> 
      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">How do we know that policies do what we want? To begin with, we need to say what we want them to do. That's why every new law and policy should include an accountability clause that states how to tell if it's working and what to do if it's not. <Link href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg" target="_blank">Scientific journals and academia are already using this strategy to limit bias in research and make experiments easier to understand</Link>. Portland can use the same approach to guarantee that our policies do what we mean, that anyone can understand what policies are for, and that we all know what will happen if they don't.</p>

      2. **Baseline experiments** 
    </div>
    <div className="collapse-content bg-secondary text-secondary-content peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white"> 
      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">Even when policies work, we want to know if they could be better. We can only know if policies are good enough when we have a baseline point of comparison.  <Link href="https://www.usaid.gov/baseline-values" target="_blank">USAID now deploys many of its interventions with an experimental control of direct cash payments so that they have something to compare their ideas against.</Link> That's what using the tools of science, statistics, and economics to design a functioning city looks like. We should implement policies alongside baseline experimental controls to maximize the impact of new legislation.</p>

      3. Progress reports
    </div>
    <div className="collapse-content bg-accent text-accent-content peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white"> 
      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">Portland City Council already has the ability to ask voters questions on ballots. For example, they could ask "on a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend that your friends and family move to Portland next year?" or "Would you rather expand the I-5 by one lane into Vancouver, or have a subway system tunneled below the river?". This is an incredibly useful tool for gauging public sentiment and understanding public priorities that has never been used before. That's why I would commit to designing a "progress report" system of questions that could be added to ballots during every cycle to better understand our successes and opportunities as a city.</p>

## Being Smart with Money

Being the healthiest, happiest, safest city in the world requires being smart with money. We only want to use our limited resources on things that realize our shared vision of a better Portland.

Should it surprise us then that we rank among the highest in suffering from addiction and needing help? While people suffering the most need us to spend resources helping them now, intervention and recovery are also the most expensive pillars of addiction response. Not only that, but these interventions take place way too late after people have already suffered too much. Spending money on education and prevention is an example of a smart use of money that the city can control today. We could be helping people avoid addiction in the first place by collaborating with schools and public transit on educational programs and campaigns. </p>

      3. Better transit requires better teamwork
    </div>
    <div className="collapse-content bg-accent text-accent-content peer-checked:bg-black peer-checked:text-white"> 
      <p className="[&>a]:text-white">Effective public transportation depends on urban planning designed around public transit. No level of investment in public transportation can make a city designed for car commuters and 18-wheelers comfortable, safe, and convenient for people without cars. That's because transit is only convenient when it's easy to reach from things people use, like attractive places to work, live, and play. This is only possible when bureaus work together to plan expansion strategically. That's why the city should be working with TriMet to purchase and develop unused land or abandoned infrastructure as part of a new, holistic approach to designing the city. We should be emulating ambitious and forward-thinking programs like <Link target="_blank" href="https://www.barcelona.cat/pla-superilla-barcelona/en/green-hubs-and-squares-eixample-district">Barcelona's SuperBlocks</Link> to ensure that we build the city around public transportation, not the other way around.</p>

## Everything Else

A city of 650,000 people is a complex place. Running an efficient city requires many more things than can be listed on a webpage or even pursued in a single person's lifetime. You may have urgent priorities or exciting ideas that you don't see described here. That makes sense! I could also list many other things that I find urgent and exciting, from <Link href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/oregon/stories-in-oregon/urban-tree-planting" target="_blank">protecting our tree canopy</Link>, to making it safer and more fun to ride bikes, to a having a subway tunnel under the river, to upgrading the HVAC in our schools and public buildings to minimize viral transmission, and much more. That diversity is a big part of Portland's grand future.

This diversity is also precisely why my policy focuses are so important. I'm not running to tell you that I have the best ideas, and that I will personally solve all your problems and realize your dreams. I don't trust or believe that message, and I know you don't either. I'm running because I believe in _your_ ideas, _our_ neighborhoods, and in people's willingness to work together when we give them a chance. Empowering communities to define their priorities, understand the available resources, and implement their solutions allows us to elevate all priorities in their hour of need. Making new laws and budgets easier to understand, evaluate, and learn from enables all Portlanders to participate in realizing their shared vision. That vision may be different from mine!

These changes are the surest way to address _whatever_ problems we may face _together_, because they use the most powerful resource we have: each other.
