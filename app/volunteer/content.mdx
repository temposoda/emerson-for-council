# Let's work together!

I'm so glad you're here. Real safety can only come from community, which only happens when we work together! Here are some things you could do right now to help:

- Write or record an endorsement for me
- Join me on the streets meeting Portlanders to spread the word and learn about their needs
- Share my story and mission on social media platforms that you use
- Let me know how you or your neighbors see a happy, healthy future for Portlander
- Contribute your own unique ideas and abilities in your own way!

Email us at <a href="mailto:contact@emersonforcouncil.com">contact@emersonforcouncil.com</a>, or call or text us at <a href="sms:+15036108072">(503)-610-8072</a> and I will personally find a way for us to work together in making Portland the place we all deserve.

Wherever you are, thanks for every single thing you do that serves the people of our community. Every act of kindness you show ensures the future of Portland is a little bit better for our families and friends.
