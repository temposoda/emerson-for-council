I'm running because I became a father this year and want my daughter to have a fantastic place to live. I want her to grow up knowing what it's like to enjoy a community that personally cares about her. I want her to be empowered to make changes when they're needed. I want her to know she is valued as a person, not as a commodity or a tax-payer. I want her to aspire to a grand vision of what her city could be - to join the world's happiest, healthiest, safest, most innovative cities.

I served on the board of the Concordia Neighborhood Association and as the representative to the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods for two years. I met neighbors facing severe hardships and neighbors with deep insights and passion for improving their community. When regular sweeps of outdoor encampments ravaged our neighbors without houses, people organized. They showed up with resources. They showed up as advocates. They recruited neighbors to help and speak out for people in need. They brought creative solutions and brokered compromise. I saw Portlanders show insight into their communal needs, empathy for their neighbors, and passion for getting involved when given opportunities.

But I also saw people that felt hopeless and frustrated. When Dan Ryan proposed Fernhill Park as a potential Safe Rest Village, neighbors were anxious and uncertain. They had questions about who it would serve, how it would help, how we would know, and how we could learn along the way. When it was clear there weren't answers, neighbors didn't know where else to turn. These experiences helped me to see that I wanted a better process for my daughter. I want her to contribute directly to realizing her community's vision of a happy, effective, modern city.

I'm committed to making participatory budgeting strategies part of the city's charter. Participatory budgeting spreads power from a few hands to many. Participatory budgeting diversifies the number of ideas we have to build our future with, empowers Portlanders with direct control over some aspects of their communities, includes more people in governing our city, and generally maximizes the potential of the best possible outcomes for Portland. It's already working in every major city on the west coast, and in cities around the world. There are other ideas I plan to champion, such as a public bank of Portland, more transparent and accountable legistlation policies, and more. 

This idea is more important than specific policies: we are more likely to find the best solutions by empowering communities to name their own problems and propose their own solutions. Together, we can take our place among the world's happiest cities. It only requires us to invest in the creative solutions of our neighborhoods and to trust the people around us at least as much as elected representatives.
