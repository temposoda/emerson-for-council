Hi, thanks for being here! It means that you care about what Portland is like, and that you want it to be a healthy, happy place for everyone that lives here. Me too! In the coming weeks and months, I'll have a lot more to say about why I'm running, how I hope to earn your trust, and what my vision for that happy, healthy Portland is. For now, I hope you're safe and well wherever you are. I hope you'll join me in imagining the most amazing future possible for Portland.

For now I hope you'll check out some other people I support:
- [The team at Portland Forward](https://www.portlandforward.org/), who care about making Portland the best possible place for everyone.
- [The team at STAR Voting](https://www.starvoting.org/), who want to ensure that democracy works for everyone and can't be gamed or abused.
- [The people at SuperThank](https://superthank.org/), who want doing good in our communities to be easier and more rewarding.
