Thank you for being here! It shows you're invested in Portland's future as much as I am. Over the next few weeks, I'll share my reasons for running and outline my vision for a thriving Portland.

For now I hope you'll join some other people I support in imagining our future together:
- [The team at Portland Forward](https://www.portlandforward.org/), who care about making Portland the best possible place for everyone.
- [The team at STAR Voting](https://www.starvoting.org/), who want to ensure that democracy works for everyone and can't be gamed or abused.
- [The people at SuperThank](https://superthank.org/), who want doing good in our communities to be easier and more rewarding.
