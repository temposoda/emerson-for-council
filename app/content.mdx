## Why City Council?

I'm running because I became a father this year and want my daughter to have a fantastic place to live. I want her to grow up knowing what it's like to enjoy a community that personally cares about her. I want her to be empowered to make changes when they're needed. I want her to know she is valued as a person, not as a commodity or a tax-payer. I want her to aspire to a grand vision of what her city could be - to join the world's happiest, healthiest, safest, most innovative cities. City Council is the most direct way for me to realize that vision, for her and all Portlanders. The kind of big, innovative ideas that make that possible start at City Council.

## Why me?

I'm a devoted parent, neighbor, and Portlander. My only interest is seeing Portland become the best place it can possibly be for my family, my community, and all Portlanders to come. I served on the board of the Concordia Neighborhood Association and as the representative to the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods for two years. I met neighbors facing severe hardships and neighbors with deep insights and passion for improving their community. When regular sweeps of outdoor encampments ravaged our neighbors without houses, people organized. They showed up with resources. They showed up as advocates. They recruited neighbors to help and speak out for people in need. They brought creative solutions and brokered compromise. I saw Portlanders show insight into their communal needs, empathy for their neighbors, and passion for getting involved when given opportunities.

But I also saw people that felt hopeless and frustrated. When Dan Ryan proposed Fernhill Park as a potential Safe Rest Village, neighbors were anxious and uncertain. They had questions about who it would serve, how it would help, how we would know, and how we could learn along the way. When it was clear there weren't answers, neighbors didn't know where else to turn. These experiences helped me to see that I wanted a better process for my daughter. I want her to contribute directly to realizing her community's vision of a happy, effective, modern city.

This idea is more important than specific policies: we are more likely to find the best solutions by empowering communities to name their own problems and propose their own solutions. Together, we can take our place among the world's happiest cities. It only requires us to invest in the creative solutions of our neighborhoods and to trust the people around us at least as much as elected representatives.

## Why now?

The most impactful changes we can make are most likely to succeed at the beginning of a new form of government. Giving communities direct authority over city money, especially those that have been marginalized and excluded in the past, will help us solve more problems more quickly. A public bank of Portland will let us invest more into our neighborhoods and quality of life than profit incentives allow. Accountability requirements will help us keep track of what's working for us and how to make improvements later. But these kind of changes are historically unpopular with elected officials and career politicians who are reluctant to share authority.

This moment is the best and possibly last time to implement a system we can all be part of, that serves all of us, and that gives us insight into how government works. These changes are the most effective way to realize all of the things that we want in the future, and we may never get another chance to have them. That's why I'm running for City Council right now, to realize that vision for all Portlanders.
